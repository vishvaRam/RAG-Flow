## Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's Laws of Motion form the foundation of **classical mechanics**, which is a theoretical science specifying the laws of motion of macroscopic objects. These laws were formulated by Isaac Newton, building upon the insights of Galileo Galilei.

### 1. Introduction to Laws of Motion

The study of motion involves understanding what governs the movement of bodies. Common experience suggests that an **external agency** or **force** is required to:
- Move a body from rest (e.g., kicking a football).
- Retard or stop motion (e.g., stopping a rolling ball).

### 2. Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)

Newton's First Law is based on Galileo's law of inertia. Galileo observed that if there were no friction, a ball moving on a horizontal plane would continue to move with a constant velocity. This led to the insight that the state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent.

**Statement of Newton's First Law:**
Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise.

### 3. Newton's Second Law of Motion

While the context lists Newton's Second Law as a topic, its explicit definition or formula ($F=ma$ or $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$) is not directly provided in a dedicated section. However, its application is demonstrated in the context of impulse and conservation of momentum.

From the context, we can infer its essence:
- **Change in momentum**: According to the second law, **F** $\Delta t$ is the change in momentum of a body when a force **F** acts for a time interval $\Delta t$.
- This implies that force is related to the rate of change of momentum.

### 4. Newton's Third Law of Motion

**Statement of Newton's Third Law (Implied from context):**
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Application and Example:**
Consider a bullet fired from a gun:
- If the force on the bullet by the gun is **F**, then the force on the gun by the bullet is **–F**. These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
- These two forces act for a common interval of time $\Delta t$.

### 5. Conservation of Momentum

The **law of conservation of momentum** is a direct consequence of Newton's second and third laws of motion.

**Derivation from Bullet-Gun System:**
1.  **Forces**: Force on bullet by gun = **F**; Force on gun by bullet = **–F** (Newton's Third Law).
2.  **Change in Momentum (Newton's Second Law)**:
    - Change in momentum of bullet = **F** $\Delta t$
    - Change in momentum of gun = **–F** $\Delta t$
3.  **Initial State**: If both the bullet and gun are initially at rest, their initial momentum is zero.
4.  **Final Momentum**:
    - Final momentum of bullet, **p***<sup>b</sup>* = **F** $\Delta t$
    - Final momentum of gun, **p***<sup>g</sup>* = **–F** $\Delta t$
5.  **Total Momentum**:
    **p***<sup>b</sup>* + **p***<sup>g</sup>* = **F** $\Delta t$ + (**–F** $\Delta t$) = 0
    This means the total momentum of the (bullet + gun) system is conserved.

### 6. Important Note on Newton's Third Law

> It is important to note that Newton's third law may not hold universally. Specifically, when dealing with **time-dependent currents and/or charges in motion**, Newton's third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or conductors. However, the **conservation of momentum of an isolated system** still holds true even in these time-dependent electromagnetic situations, provided the momentum carried by the fields themselves is also taken into account.
