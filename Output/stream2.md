## Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics, building upon the revolutionary ideas of Galileo. These laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and how these forces affect its motion.

### Newton's First Law of Motion

**Newton's First Law of Motion**, also known as the **Law of Inertia**, states that: "Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise."

This law essentially means that if the **net external force** on a body is zero, its **acceleration** is zero.
*   A body at rest will remain at rest.
*   A body in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity (uniform motion in a straight line).

The property of a body to resist changes in its state of rest or uniform motion is called **inertia**.

**Formula:**
If $\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = 0$, then $\mathbf{a} = 0$.

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

**Newton's Second Law of Motion** describes how force, mass, and acceleration are related. It states: "The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts."

**Momentum** ($\mathbf{p}$) of a body is defined as the product of its mass ($m$) and velocity ($\mathbf{v}$):
$$\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}$$

According to the second law, the applied force ($\mathbf{F}$) is proportional to the rate of change of momentum:
$$\mathbf{F} = k \frac{\mathbf{dp}}{\mathbf{d}t}$$
In SI units, the constant of proportionality $k$ is set to 1. Therefore, the equation becomes:
$$\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathbf{d}t}$$
For a constant mass $m$, this simplifies to:
$$\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}$$
where $\mathbf{F}$ is the net external force on the body and $\mathbf{a}$ is its acceleration.

The SI unit of force is the **newton (N)**, where $1 \text{ N} = 1 \text{ kg m s}^{-2}$.

### Newton's Third Law of Motion

Newton's Third Law of Motion is mentioned in the context of its application to systems of particles and angular momentum, but its statement is not explicitly provided. However, it is crucial for understanding the interaction between bodies. It is also used in establishing the time rate of change of total angular momentum of a system of particles.

**Note:** The provided context does not explicitly state Newton's Third Law of Motion. It only mentions its necessity for certain derivations, such as for finite-sized bodies or systems of particles, and for establishing the relationship between the time rate of change of total angular momentum and total external torque.
