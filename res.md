Here's an explanation of Newton's laws of motion:\n\n### Newton's First Law of Motion\n\nNewton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that \"Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise.\" In simpler terms, if the external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. This means a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in uniform motion will continue to move with constant velocity in a straight line, unless an external force acts upon it.\n\n**Examples:**\n*   To move a football at rest, an external kick (force) is needed.\n*   To throw a stone upwards, an upward push (force) is required.\n*   To stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane, a force must be applied against the direction of its motion.\n\n### Newton's Second Law of Motion\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that \"The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.\"\n\nMomentum ($\\mathbf{p}$) of a body is the product of its mass ($m$) and velocity ($\\mathbf{v}$):\n$\\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v}$\n\nThe second law can be expressed mathematically as:\n$\\mathbf{F} = k \\frac{\\mathbf{dp}}{\\mathbf{d}t}$\n\nIn SI units, the constant of proportionality $k$ is set to 1. Therefore:\n$\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\mathbf{dp}}{\\mathbf{d}t}$\n\nIf the mass $m$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}$ is the net external force on the body and $\\mathbf{a}$ is its acceleration.\n\nThe SI unit of force is newton (N), where 1 N = 1 kg m s$^{-2}$.\n\n**Example:**\nThe force on a ball by a batsman and the time of contact are often difficult to know, but the impulse (which is the change in momentum) can be readily calculated. For instance, an impulse of 3.6 N s in the direction from the batsman to the bowler indicates the net effect of the force over the contact time.\n\n### Newton's Third Law of Motion\n\nNewton's third law of motion describes the nature of external forces. It states that external force on a body always arises due to some other body. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on body A.\n\n**Examples:**\n*   If you press a coiled spring, the spring is compressed by the force of your hand. The compressed spring, in turn, exerts an equal and opposite force on your hand, which you can feel.\n*   The Earth pulls a stone downwards due to gravity. According to Newton's third law, the stone exerts an equal and opposite force on the Earth. Although we do not notice the effect on the Earth's motion because of its very large mass, the force is present.
