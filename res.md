## Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's laws of motion are fundamental principles that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. These laws form the basis of **classical mechanics**.

### 1. Newton's First Law of Motion

Newton's First Law of Motion is also known as the **law of inertia**. It states:

> "Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise."

In simpler terms, if the **net external force** on a body is zero, its **acceleration** is zero. This means a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in uniform motion will continue to move with constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force.

**Examples:**

- To move a football at rest, someone must kick it, applying an external force. Without this force, it remains at rest.
- A ball rolling down an inclined plane can be stopped by applying a force against the direction of its motion. Without this opposing force (and assuming no friction), the ball would continue its motion.
- If a body is moving with constant velocity, it requires no external force to maintain that motion (neglecting friction, which is an opposing force in practice).

### 2. Newton's Second Law of Motion

Newton's Second Law of Motion quantifies the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It states:

> "The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts."

#### Momentum

The **momentum** ($\mathbf{p}$) of a body is defined as the product of its mass ($m$) and velocity ($\mathbf{v}$):

$$
\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}
$$

#### Force and Acceleration

According to Newton's Second Law, the force ($\mathbf{F}$) is proportional to the rate of change of momentum ($\frac{\mathbf{dp}}{\mathbf{d}t}$).

$$
\mathbf{F} = k \frac{\mathbf{dp}}{\mathbf{d}t}
$$

Where $k$ is the constant of proportionality. In SI units, $k = 1$.
Thus, the equation becomes:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathbf{d}t}
$$

Since $\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}$, and assuming mass $m$ is constant, we can write:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathbf{d}(m\mathbf{v})}{\mathbf{d}t} = m \frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathbf{d}t}
$$

As acceleration ($\mathbf{a}$) is defined as the rate of change of velocity ($\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathbf{d}t}$), the most common form of Newton's Second Law is:

$$
\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{F}$ is the net external force acting on the body, and $\mathbf{a}$ is its acceleration. The acceleration is in the same direction as the net force.

**SI Unit of Force:**
The SI unit of force is the **newton (N)**.

$$
1 \, \text{N} = 1 \, \text{kg m s}^{-2}
$$

**Example:**

- When someone kicks a football (applying an external force), the football accelerates (changes its velocity) in the direction of the kick. The magnitude of this acceleration depends on the force applied and the mass of the football. A harder kick (greater force) results in greater acceleration.
